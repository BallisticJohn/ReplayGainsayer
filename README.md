ReplayGainsayer is a tool to help music fans identify the best masters of their favorite music, and avoid remasters that are worse than the originals for having compressed dynamic range as casualities of "the loudness wars."

ReplayGainsayer allows a user to search for an artist by name on Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, or Qobuz, and identify which albums are available under that artist name on those streaming services.

It will then act to determine the loudness of each album (not each track) in something similar to dBfs (deciBels relative to full scale; EBU or ITU LUFS or LKFS are ideal, but ReplayGain or other loudness measurement are also quite usable).

The output is a list of albums and a red-yellow-green classification system for albums that have been "brick walled" (greater than -6 dBfs, with an icon of a red brick wall), significantly compressed (-11 to -6 dBfs, with an icon of a clamp or vice squeezing a yellow folder, reminiscent of the WinZip icon), or reasonably dynamic (less than -11 dBfs, with a happy green icon).

Eventually, ReplayGainsayer may help fans to discover the best masters across streaming platforms and choose to listen to better music.
